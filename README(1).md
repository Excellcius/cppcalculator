# Overview

I took on the challenge of building this calculator app to broaden my skills in C++. Creating a calculator seemed like a perfect way to reinforce my coding basics while delving into the nuances of a new language.

In the process of expanding my programming horizons, I wanted a project that struck a balance between the familiar and the novel. A calculator app, despite its simplicity, provided an excellent platform to apply my existing knowledge and explore the unique features of C++.

This project allowed me to solidify my grasp of fundamental programming concepts in C++, such as variables, functions, and control flow structures. Simultaneously, I tackled new concepts specific to C++, like pointers, memory management, and the intricacies of object-oriented programming.

# Development Environment

I used C++ and cmath in order to write this code! Cmath is super easy to implement as you only need to type #include <cmath> as I did at the start of the code and it 
is ready to do all the math you need.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I would love to add a grapgical UI of some sort!
- Having more than two numbers to calculate
- More functions within the calculator itself
